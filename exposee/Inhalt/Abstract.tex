In my master's thesis I will investigate using neural networks for self driving and the practicability of using reinforcement learning for the training process. The reinforcement learning agent's task is to complete a parcour in a simulated environment without collisions. The thesis will build upon previous student's work at the Scads.AI by changing implementation and training details. The goal is to improve the agent's performance and evaluate the changes. The work will be compared to the results of the previous thesis \autocite{maximilian}.
