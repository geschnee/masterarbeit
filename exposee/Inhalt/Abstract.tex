In my master's thesis I will investigate using neural networks for self driving. The goal is to create an autonomous driving agent that is resilient to changes in light conditions. The agent will employ preprocessing steps and a convolutional neural network to achieve this. The agent will be trained using reinforcement learning in a simulated environment with changing light conditions to help the agent generalize.

The reinforcement learning agent's task is to complete a parcour in a simulated environment without collisions. The thesis builds upon previous student's work at the ScaDS.AI \autocite{maximilian}, the task specifications and evaluation approaches are reused for comparability. This thesis focusses on improving the resiliency to changing light conditions.

% TODO ScaDS.AI ist die Schreibweise, wird sie auch im Text so verwendet?
