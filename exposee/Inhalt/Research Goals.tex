The goal of this thesis is to contribute in the domain of autonomous driving by investigating the efficiency and contributions of different implementation details using reinforcement learning in a simulated environment. The thesis will build on the work of \autocite{maximilian} and review the utilised algorithms and implementation details. Implementation changes will be proposed based on research in the field of reinforcement learning and autonomous driving. The contributions of these implementation details will be evaluated on their own and in combination with each other. 

The self driving agent is trained and evaluated on a simulated parcour. Different parcours, lighting settings and motor-power settings are used to evaluate the agent's reliability and generalisation capabilities. The evaluation scenarios will consist of the ones employed by \autocite{maximilian} and potentially additional ones based on related work and the investigated implementation changes.

The task of driving through the parcour is motivated in part by the Scads.AI research facility, it would be ideal to be able to transfer the agent from this thesis to a physical arena at the Scads.AI research facility. The Scads.AI premises are often used for exhibitions and events where a physical self driving agent could be used to raise interest in applications of AI and research. %TODO move this to motivation?


Um ehrlich zu sein war es schwierig diese Paragraphen zu schreiben. Es war schwierig Research Goals zu formulieren, die unterschiedlich von den vorherigen sind.
