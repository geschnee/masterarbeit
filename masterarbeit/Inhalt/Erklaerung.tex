\addchap{Declaration of Autonomy}
I hereby declare that I have written the Master's thesis with the title:

\begin{center}
\textit{\glqq\titel\grqq}\\[1em]
\end{center}
			
independently, that I have not used resources other than those specified and that all statements taken verbatim or meaningfully from other works have been marked as such. I am aware that any violation can also lead to the revocation of the degree retroactively. I further declare, that the electronic copy coincides exactly with the printed exemplar.
