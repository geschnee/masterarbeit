\chapter{Experiment how to find the hyperparameters}


\section{Experiment mixed light setting hyperparameter}
\label{cha:experiment_mixed_training}

Experiment mixed taining hyperparameter

explain how the training with mixed light setting was worse than the training with fixed standard light setting


\section{Experiment mixed light setting so histo equalization}
\label{cha:experiment_mixed_training_no_equalization}

maybe training with mixed light settings and no equalization durchf√ºhren?
